LeetCode
========

[LeetCode problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) and how
I [solved them](https://leetcode.com/therenotomorrow/).

Structure
---------

- [Explore](./explore) - useful technics shortcuts for learn
- [Solutions](./solutions) - all solved and refactored problems
- [Again](legacy/again) - need resolve because of loosing day streak or not enough knowledge
- [Archive](legacy/arch) - all solved problems that in progress refactoring
- [Todos](./todos) - something special for resolve and revise

Development
-----------

After adding some code samples run [`code.sh`](./scripts/code.sh)

```shell
make code
```

You can automate this action by calling [`pre-commit`](./.githooks/pre-commit)

```shell
# setup pre-commit and check integrity
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Testing
-------

```shell
# fast unit tests to be sure that no regression was 
make test/smoke
# same as test/smoke but with -race condition check
make test/unit
# same as test/smoke but with creation local coverage report in HTML for golang
make test/coverage
```
